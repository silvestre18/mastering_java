/* This file will explain the structure of a class */

/* The first concept to be understood is the difference between a file.java and a file.class
   the code is saved in a file.java , this file is compiled and creates a file.class which can be 
   read by the JVM and run the program */

     int a1;                        // those are called objects field or instance variables
     char b1;                       // those will be explained later
